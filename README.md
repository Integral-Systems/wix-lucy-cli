# Lucy-CLI

![Lucy-CLI](lucy.jpg)

## Motivation

Lucy-CLI was developed out of a personal need to gain full TypeScript support for Wix Velo projects. Typically, using Wixâ€™s GitHub integration provides JSON docs and basic type support, but I aimed for a more integrated TypeScript experience, especially for larger projects that benefit from enhanced type safety.

Lucy, my loyal dog, accompanied me during long nights working on a major project where I developed this CLI. Her companionship and resilience inspired the name "Lucy-CLI."

## CAUTION: Thing to keep in mind before using Lucy-CLI

This CLI is still in development and may have bugs. Please use it with caution.
Libraries are expected to have the same folder structure as  the main typescript folder except for the pages folder.
(backend, public, styles)
The lucy CLI is opinionated and may not work with all projects.

## What It Does

Lucy-CLI is designed to streamline the setup and management of TypeScript within Wix Velo projects, providing tools to enhance code quality and reduce development time. Hereâ€™s what it offers:

1. **ESLint Configuration**  
   - Adds ESLint with a default configuration (customizable post-init) to maintain consistent code style and prevent common errors.

2. **Wix Type Definitions**  
   - Exposes Wix type definitions located in `.wix/types/wix-code-types`, allowing direct import and access to the types for comprehensive TypeScript support.

3. **Autocomplete and Type Mapping for Page Elements**  
   - Maps Wix page elements to their respective types, so `$w('element')` calls have full TypeScript support, including autocomplete for properties and methods.

4. **Git Submodule Support**  
   - Includes support for git submodules, providing full type support within submodules and enabling the use of libraries and types across projects.
   - To add a submodule, include the following in the `lucy.json` file:

      ``` json
      "modules": {
        "<repoName>": {
          "url": "String",
          "branch": "String"
        }
      }
      ```

1. **Configurable Setup**  
   - After initialization, Lucy-CLI creates a `lucy-config.json` configuration file where you can modify settings, add dev packages, specify Wix packages, and configure git submodules.

2. **Execute render functions**  
   - Lucy-CLI can execute render functions located in the backend template folder, allowing you to test render functions locally.

3. **compile sccs files**  
   - Lucy-CLI can compile scss files to css files.
   - It compiles styles/global.scss file to global.css.

4. **Wix NPM Package Installation**
   - Lucy-CLI can install Wix npm packages from the `lucy.json` file in the project directory.

5. **Teting with Vitest**
   - Lucy-CLI can run tests with Vitest.
   - It runs tests located backend folder with the file name ending with `.spec.ts`.
   - it creates a code coverage report in the coverage folder in the lib folders and typescript folders.
   - Vitest is looking for mokes in typescript folder and lib folder.
     - You can add additional mock folders in vitest.config.ts file.

6.  **Linting with ESLint**
    - Lucy-CLI can lint the code with ESLint.
    - It uses the ESLint configuration in the `.eslintrc.cjs` file in the project directory.  

7.  **Add git version during production build**
      - Lucy-CLI can add the git version to the production build.
      - It adds the git version to the `public/constant/env.ts` file in the public folder under the key gitTag.

## Commands & Options

Lucy-CLI comes with a range of commands and options to help manage your Wix Velo project. Hereâ€™s an overview:

### Commands

- **`init`**: Initializes the current folder as a Wix project, creating essential configuration files.
- **`dev`**: Starts the development environment, including setting up any required services for local development.
- **`build-prod`**: Builds the project in production mode, optimizing files for deployment.
- **`prepare`**: Re-runs initialization commands, useful for setting up a pre-configured environment.
- **`sync`**: Synchronizes the database and any dependencies or configurations necessary for the project.
- **`install`**: Installs all Wix npm packages listed in the `wixpkgs.json` file in the project directory.
- **`fix`**: Runs a fix command to resolve common issues in development or production settings.
- **ðŸ¦® `docs`**: Generates documentation for the project.
- **ðŸ¦® `cypress`**: Starts the Cypress test runner.
- **ðŸ¦® `e2e`**: Starts the Cypress test runner in CI mode.  
  **Usage:** `e2e <someKey> <someID>`  
  - **`someKey`**: The key for the test.  
  - **`someID`**: The build ID for the test.

### Options

- **`-h, help`**: Displays the help message with command descriptions.
- **`-v, version`**: Shows the current version of Lucy-CLI as defined in the projectâ€™s `package.json`.
- **`-f, force`**: Forces specific commands to execute, useful for deleting obsolete pages or initializing missing components.
- **`-l`**: Locks package versions to those specified in the configuration file during installation.
