## Motivation

Lucy-CLI was developed out of a personal need to gain full TypeScript support for Wix Velo projects. Typically, using Wix's GitHub integration provides JSON docs and basic type support, but I aimed for a more integrated TypeScript experience, especially for larger projects that benefit from enhanced type safety.

Lucy, my loyal dog, accompanied me during long nights working on a major project where I developed this CLI. Her companionship and resilience inspired the name "Lucy-CLI."

## Important Notes Before Using Lucy-CLI

This CLI is still in development and may have bugs. Please use it with caution.

### Project Types Overview

Lucy-CLI supports multiple project types, each with different requirements and configurations:

#### Wix Velo Projects (`init velo`)
- **Purpose**: Full TypeScript support for Wix Velo development
- **Requirements**: 
  - Libraries must have the same folder structure as the main TypeScript folder (backend, public, styles)
  - Composite and declaration tsconfig settings must be set to false for type reexport
- **Limitations**: Opinionated structure - may not work with all projects

**Backend Endpoint Import Pattern:**
```javascript
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment
//@ts-ignore
import { initialize, InitResponse } from 'backend/lib/initialize.web';
```

#### Other Project Types
- **Expo** (`init expo`): React Native with Expo framework
- **Blocks** (`init blocks`): Wix Blocks development
- **Monorepo** (`init monorepo`): Nx-based monorepo setup
- **Tauri** (`init tauri`): Desktop applications with Tauri
- **Cargo** (`init cargo`): Rust projects
- **Wix SDK** (`init wix-sdk`): Wix SDK integration

### Template System

Lucy-CLI uses a centralized template system located at `~/.lucy-cli` (your home directory). This folder contains:
- Default project configurations
- File structure templates for each project type
- Customizable settings and configurations

## What It Does

Lucy-CLI is designed to streamline the setup and management of TypeScript within Wix Velo projects, providing tools to enhance code quality and reduce development time. Here's what it offers:

1.  **ESLint Configuration**
   - Adds ESLint with a default configuration (customizable post-init) to maintain consistent code style and prevent common errors.

2.  **Wix Type Definitions**
   - Exposes Wix type definitions located in `.wix/types/wix-code-types`, allowing direct import and access to the types for comprehensive TypeScript support.

3.  **Autocomplete and Type Mapping for Page Elements**
   - Maps Wix page elements to their respective types, so `$w('element')` calls have full TypeScript support, including autocomplete for properties and methods.

4.  **Git Submodule Support**
   - Includes support for git submodules, providing full type support within submodules and enabling the use of libraries and types across projects.
   - To add a submodule, include the following in the `lucy.json` file:

      ```json
      "modules": {
        "<repoName>": {
            "url": "String",
            "branch": "String",
            "path": "String", // Optional, specifies the path where the submodule should be cloned
            "noCompile": true // Optional, if true, the module will not be compiled
        }
      }
      ```

5.  **Configurable Setup**
   - After initialization, Lucy-CLI creates a `lucy-config.json` configuration file where you can modify settings, add dev packages, specify Wix packages, and configure git submodules.

6.  **Execute Render Functions**
   - Lucy-CLI can execute render functions located in the backend template folder, allowing you to test render functions locally.

7.  **Compile SCSS Files**
   - Lucy-CLI can compile SCSS files to CSS files.
   - It compiles the `styles/global.scss` file to `global.css`.

8.  **Wix NPM Package Installation**
   - Lucy-CLI can install Wix npm packages from the `lucy.json` file.

9.  **Testing with Vitest**
   - Lucy-CLI can run tests with Vitest.
   - It runs tests located in the backend folder with file names ending with `.spec.ts`.
   - It creates a code coverage report in the coverage folder in the lib folders and TypeScript folders.
   - Vitest looks for mocks in the TypeScript folder and lib folder.
     - You can add additional mock folders in the `vitest.config.ts` file.

10. **Linting with ESLint**
    - Lucy-CLI can lint the code with ESLint.
    - It uses the ESLint configuration in the `.eslintrc.cjs` file in the project directory.  

11. **Add Git Version During Production Build**
      - Lucy-CLI can add the git version to the production build.
      - It adds the git version to the `public/constant/env.ts` file in the public folder under the key `gitTag`.

12. **Use Velo-Sync to Synchronize Local Collections with Wix**
      - Lucy-CLI can synchronize local collections with Wix collections.
      - More information can be found in the [velo-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/velo-sync) documentation.

13. **Synchronize `package.json` with `lucy.json`**
    - Lucy-CLI can synchronize dependencies from your project's `package.json` directly into the `lucy.json` configuration. The `dependencies` are mapped to `wixPackages` and `devDependencies` are mapped to `devPackages`.

14. **Manage CLI Templates**
    - Lucy-CLI uses a templates folder (`~/.lucy-cli`) to store default configurations and file structures for the `init` command. Use the `open` command to access and customize these templates.
